Attiny45-powered temperature sensor communicating with the Sigfox network. It is using the BRKWS01 board from the [SNOC](https://snoc.fr/) to transmit temperature data to the network which allows it to be installed anywhere as long as it stays in Sigfox's [coverage map](https://www.sigfox.com/coverage/).
